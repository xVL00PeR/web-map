What is web-map?:
	Web-map is a script which scans a webpage searching URI's, and checking
	if the webpage is done with wordpress.
	The program finds the URI's by doing brute-force with GET's.
	After completing the scan, if the page is done with wordpress,
	you can try brute-forcing the wp-login. 


How do I install web-map?:
	1.- Type "chmod 755 setup.py" on your terminal
	2.- Type "./setup.py" on your terminal
	3.- After installing web-map, run the program by typing "./web-map.py"

This program is on early-release, so may be plenty of bugs, sorry for the inconvenience.

I hope you enjoy the script,
